# Oi!

My name is Armando Magalh√£es. I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer living in Amsterdam since 2018.

Currently I work as a Solutions Developer at [Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/teams/).

Previously, I worked as a Senior Product Engineer at [Framer](https://framer.com), and as a Software Engineer at [Travix](https://travix.com).

I share things I find nice at https://go.armand1m.dev/neat.

I'm also a moderator at a telegram group focusing in tips and life abroad for Brazilian Software Engineers. Join us at https://go.armand1m.dev/png

## Things I'm focusing now

### üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Work</summary>

In working hours, I focus in delivering solutions to problems. Some require code, some don't. 

I strive to bring awareness, innovation and inspiration when working on teams, even remotely.
I'm being challenged everyday, I'm doing different things than what I was used to.

Hopefully it means I'm growing :)

### üìñ  Learning and Development

I've been trying to free myself from my javascript comfort zone lately. 

On my free time, I've been studying a lot of functional programming with Haskell by reading lectures, creating personal projects and practicing by writing algorithms and data structures through https://codewars.com exercises. ([follow me on codewars!](https://www.codewars.com/users/armand1m))

Currently, as a starter project, I've been running a personal information api built with [Yesod](https://www.yesodweb.com/), deployed at https://info.armand1m.dev

This API currently empowers https://armand1m.dev

```sh
# fetch my working experiences from armand1m.dev
curl https://info.armand1m.dev/linkedin

# fetch content from armand1m.dev/neat
curl https://info.armand1m.dev/neat-things
```

I'm considering migrating it to [IHP](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/) as I plan to add a few more features as time goes by.

Sometimes I over-engineer things to experiment situations I haven't been exposed directly at work.

I deploy my applications into a terraform-based kubernetes cluster powered by istio in google cloud platform, even though they could perfectly fit a Netlify or Vercel deployment.

I've learned a lot about infrastructure-as-code and devops practices through my career by working on companies that are empowered by these practices, and I like to explore this field on my free time by leveraging them for my own usage.
