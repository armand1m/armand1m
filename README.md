# Oi!

My name is Armando Magalh√£es. I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer living in Amsterdam since 2018.

Currently I work as a Solutions Developer at [Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/teams/).

Previously, I worked as a Senior Product Engineer at [Framer](https://framer.com), and as a Software Engineer at [Travix](https://travix.com).

I share things I find nice at https://armand1m.dev/neat

## Things I'm focusing now

### üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Work</summary>

In working hours, I focus in delivering solutions to problems. Some require code, some don't. 

I strive to bring awareness, innovation and inspiration when working on teams, even remotely.
I'm being challenged everyday, I'm doing different things than what I was used to.

Hopefully it means I'm growing :)


### üìñ  Learning and Development

I've been trying to free myself from my javascript comfort zone lately. 

On my free time, I've been studying a lot of functional programming with Haskell by reading lectures, creating personal projects and practicing by writing algorithms and data structures through https://codewars.com exercises. ([follow me on codewars!](https://www.codewars.com/users/armand1m))

Currently, I've been running an API in Haskell in production is a personal information api I've built with Yesod, deployed at https://info.armand1m.dev 

```sh
# fetch my working experiences from armand1m.dev
curl https://info.armand1m.dev/linkedin

# fetch content from armand1m.dev/neat
curl https://info.armand1m.dev/neat-things
```

I do have my own Kubernetes cluster deployed in Google Cloud Platform.
In this cluster I apply my DevOps learnings and host my own applications.
