I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer living in Amsterdam since 2018.

As of Q1 2024, I'm still working at [Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/teams/) as a Software Engineer for 4 years.

I'm one of the moderators at [Programando na Gringa](https://go.d1m.dev/png): a safe virtual space to talk about immigrant and expat life and for Brazilians looking to learn more about working abroad with tech with other Brazilians who have been doing this for years.
