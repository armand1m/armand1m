# :wave: Oi!

My name is Armando Magalh√£es. I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer living in Amsterdam since 2018.

Currently I work as a Solutions Developer at [Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/teams/).

Previously, I worked as a Senior Product Engineer at [Framer](https://framer.com) and as a Software Engineer at [Travix](https://travix.com).

I share things I find nice at https://go.d1m.dev/neat.

I'm also a moderator at a telegram group focusing in tips and life abroad for Brazilian Software Engineers. Join us at https://go.d1m.dev/png

## Things I'm focusing now

### üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Work</summary>

In working hours, I focus in delivering solutions to problems. Some require code, some don't. 

I strive to bring awareness, innovation and inspiration when working on teams, even remotely.
I'm being challenged everyday, I'm doing different things than what I was used to. Hopefully it means I'm growing :)

As of technology, when needed, I tend to leverage Node.js, React, Typescript and GraphQL to build solutions.

While this is my goto stack, sometimes I have to get hands-on with Java, Python, Go, or infrastructure tooling, and I find joy working with these as well.

### üìñ  Learning and Development

I've been working a lot with Next.js and GraphQL lately. As of Aug 2020, I'm building [a Golinks implementation using Next.js, PostGraphile and Auth0](https://go.d1m.dev/source) for fun. This project is deployed at https://go.d1m.dev, hence I use it as my main url shortener.

At the same time, I've been trying to free myself from my javascript comfort zone lately. 

So I've been studying a lot of functional programming with Haskell by reading lectures, creating personal projects and practicing by training how I implement algorithms and data structures through https://codewars.com exercises. ([follow me on codewars!](https://www.codewars.com/users/armand1m))

Currently, as a starter project, I've been running a personal information api built with [Yesod](https://www.yesodweb.com/), deployed at https://info.armand1m.dev

This API currently empowers https://armand1m.dev

```sh
# fetch my working experiences from armand1m.dev
curl https://info.armand1m.dev/linkedin

# fetch content from armand1m.dev/neat
curl https://info.armand1m.dev/neat-things
```

Sometimes I over-engineer things to experiment situations I haven't been exposed directly at work for studying purposes.

I deploy my applications into a terraform-based kubernetes cluster powered by istio in google cloud platform with preemptible machines, even though they could perfectly fit a Netlify or Vercel deployment. Definitely more to manage than I'd need.

I've learned a lot about infrastructure-as-code and devops practices through my career by working on companies that are empowered by these practices, and I like to explore this field on my free time by leveraging them for my own usage.

I like to be exposed to challenges. Sometimes, I figure out my own :)

This is my github page, and props to you if you got to the end of this boring and huge README file, cheers! üçª
