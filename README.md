I am a software engineer living in amsterdam for quite a while now.
I can speak english, portuguese, spanish and my dutch is not amazing but not terrible either.
I spent most of my career working on big distributed systems, from infrastructure to user interface.
I've worked in many different industries but I did spend over 6 years working at Netflix from Amsterdam.
I write some _(mostly non-technical)_ stuff at https://armand1m.dev/writing
