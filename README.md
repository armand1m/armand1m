I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer living in Amsterdam since 2018.

Currently, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/teams/).

Previously, I worked as a Senior Product Engineer at [Framer](https://framer.com) and as a Software Engineer at [Travix](https://travix.com).

I'm one of the moderators at [Programando na Gringa](https://go.d1m.dev/png): a safe virtual space for everyone to talk about immigrant and expat life and for Brazilians looking to learn more about working abroad with tech.
