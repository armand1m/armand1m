# :wave: Oi!

I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer living in Amsterdam since 2018.

Currently I work as a Solution Developer at [Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/teams/).

Previously, I worked as a Senior Product Engineer at [Framer](https://framer.com) and as a Software Engineer at [Travix](https://travix.com).

I'm also one of the moderators at Programando na Gringa, a safe virtual space for everyone to talk about expat life and for Brazilians looking to work abroad with tech. Join us at https://go.d1m.dev/png
