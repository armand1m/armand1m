# :wave: Oi!

My name is Armando Magalh√£es. I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer living in Amsterdam since 2018.

Currently I work as a Solutions Developer at [Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/teams/).

Previously, I worked as a Senior Product Engineer at [Framer](https://framer.com) and as a Software Engineer at [Travix](https://travix.com).

I share things I find nice at https://go.d1m.dev/neat.

I'm also a moderator at a telegram group focusing in tips and life abroad for Brazilian Software Engineers. Join us at https://go.d1m.dev/png
