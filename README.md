I am a software engineer living in amsterdam for quite a while now.<br>
I spent most of my career working on tooling and big distributed systems:

 - from infrastructure aspects: _k8s, terraform, ci/cd systems, replication patterns, leader selection, clustering, mqtt servers_
 - to everything in between: _grpc, graphql, restful apis, wsdls, websockets, dsl's and so on_
 - all the way to the user interface: _mostly react and typescript and the huge ecosystem of tooling around_<br>

I guess I just really enjoy building things :)<br>

I worked a lot as a consultant in Brazil. <br>
When moving to The Netherlands, I worked at some cool places like Travix _(now https://trip.com and https://cheaptickets.nl)_ and [Framer](https://framer.com).<br>

For the past 6 years I've been working at Netflix.<br>
You can check https://armand1m.dev/work for more on that.<br>

I can speak english, portuguese, spanish and my dutch is not amazing but not terrible either.<br>
I write some _(mostly non-technical)_ stuff at https://armand1m.dev/writing
